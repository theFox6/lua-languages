## Languages that compile to Lua
Lua is famously and deceptively simple and enables many different programming paradigms. Like Javascript, it's possible to make it shine by adding more specialized syntax. I started this list to document the languages I found looking for an ML/F# like language.

Pull requests welcome!

### Compile to bytecode
An intriguing new avenue of development started by [Rochus Keller](https://github.com/rochus-keller) for an Oberon to LuaJIT bytecode compiler provides an elegant way of leveraging the ecosystem:
 - https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/
  Oberon compiler
 - https://github.com/franko/luajit-lang-toolkit
  A Lua to LuaJIT bytecode compiler/toolkit to enable different language frontends and different compilation backends.
 - https://github.com/rochus-keller/LjTools 
  LuaJIT tools, a Qt5 GUI parser, browser, assembler and test VM for LuaJIT 2.0 bytecode

### Tier 1
For lack of a better designator, these projects are well known, or compiles existing languages
 - http://moonscript.org/
 Moonscript, indentation based syntax, based on coffeescript
 
 - http://haxe.org
 Haxe, strongly typed OO language transpiler with multiple backends
 
 - https://github.com/yanghuan/CSharp.lua
 C# transpiler
 
 - https://github.com/theFox6/LuaVenusCompiler
 Transpiler for [Venus](https://github.com/retroverse/venus), a Go-like language, 
 
 - https://github.com/gijit/gi translates Go into Lua. It targets LuaJIT for 64-bit integer support.
